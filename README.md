# Self Attention Classifier
This project explores the use of attention mechanisms for news group classification tasks. News articles have a sequential structure, with relevant information spread throughout the text. Traditional classification models may overlook this sequential nature. Our approach employs an attention-based model that can dynamically focus on the most informative segments of the input text while deemphasizing irrelevant content.
